Assignment 3 : ECSE 427

Compiled and ran on a Windows machine.

I did not use any external DLL.

I could not add the BackingStore folder in the the zipped file,
therefore the first time the code is ran, 
there will be no BackingStore folder,
it will print an error but the code will still work.
This will not happen after the first time running the code
